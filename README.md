# Smart Sort ♻️

**Smart Sort** is an open-source, AI-powered mobile app designed to make waste segregation simple and intuitive.  
Point your camera at an item, and let AI tell you which bin it belongs to.

> **STATUS:** 🚀 *In Development (Actively Seeking Contributors!)*  
> Born from the *OneEarth International Hackathon 2025*, Smart Sort is now being developed as a full-scale, community-driven open-source project.  
> We are actively looking for contributors to help us build **V1.0**!

## 🌱 Project Vision

Our **V1.0** goal is to deliver a **finished, reliable app** for the waste sorting rules in **Bengaluru, India (BBMP)**, while building a flexible framework that can be adapted to **any city in the world**.

---

## ⚙️ Core Features

### 🤖 On-Device AI  
Uses a custom **TensorFlow Lite** model for instant, offline-capable waste classification.

### 📱 Cross-Platform  
Built with **React Native** to support both Android and iOS.

### 👤 User Accounts  
Integrated with **Firebase** to track scan history and sorting statistics.

### 🌍 Scalable Architecture  
Easily extendable to support city-specific AI models and waste classification rules.
