Smart Sort ♻️

Smart Sort is an open-source, AI-powered mobile app designed to make waste segregation simple and intuitive. Point your camera at an item, and let AI tell you which bin it belongs to.

Our V1.0 goal is to provide a "finished," reliable app for the waste sorting rules in Bengaluru, India (BBMP), while building a framework that can be adapted for any city in the world.

STATUS: 🚀 In Development (Actively Seeking Contributors!)

This project was born from the OneEarth International Hackathon 2025 and is now being developed as a full-scale, open-source project. We are actively looking for contributors to help us build V1.0.

Core Features

🤖 On-Device AI: Uses a custom TensorFlow Lite model for instant, offline-capable waste classification.

📱 Cross-Platform: Built with React Native for both Android and iOS.

👤 User Accounts: Powered by Firebase to track your scan history and personal sorting stats.

🌍 Scalable: The app's architecture is designed to support multiple city-specific models.

Our "Finished Project" Roadmap (V1.0)

[ ] AI Model: Refine the TFLite model to >90% accuracy for the 3 main BBMP categories (Wet, Dry, Sanitary).

[ ] Backend: Implement Firebase Authentication and a Firestore database schema for user scan history.

[ ] Mobile App:

[ ] User Sign-Up / Login screens.

[ ] The core "Tap to Scan" camera screen.

[ ] A "Scan History" screen that pulls data from Firestore.

[ ] Launch: Publish the V1.0 app on the Google Play Store.
